# BCG_Data_Science_Virtual_Internship
This repository seeks to share my experience gained through the participation in the BGG virtual data science internship. The repo shows the kind of problems solved at BCG X and attempts to simulate the challenges faced by data scientist in meeting client's goal through challenging data analysis.

# Task 1: Business understanding and hypothesis testing
* Approach to problem and hypothesis testing.
* Formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis, focusing on the data you would need from the client as well as the analytical models you would use to test the hypothesis.

**Key Considerations**
* What are the key factors for a customer deciding to stay with or switch providers?
* Data sources and fields that could be used to explore the contribution of various factors to a customer’s potential action
* What would a data frame of your choice look like — what should each column and row represent?
* What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights into churn behaviour?

# Task 2: Exploratory data analysis
Build a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. 

# Task 3: Feature engineering and modelling
Identify the key drivers of churn for the client and build those features to later use in your model.

# Task 4: Findings and recommendations
Provide a summary of the key findings
